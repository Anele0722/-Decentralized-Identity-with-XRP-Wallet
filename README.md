## Introduction

The project is about linking an existing Student Card with the XRP Wallet. An over view of the steps required.

Generate a DID: You'll need to generate a DID. A DID is a unique identifier that's associated with a person, organization, or device. 

Create a Verifiable Credential: A verifiable credential is a piece of information that can be used to prove claims about a DID. In this case, it could be a proof of ownership of an XRP wallet.

Interact with XRP Ledger: To link the DID to an XRP wallet, you'll need to interact with the XRP Ledger. You can do this using the XRP Ledger API. You'll need to create an XRP wallet and associate it with the DID.
