## Introduction

The project is about Digitl Identity linked with an XRP Wallet. 

## Features

- Integration of DIDs with XRP Wallets.
- Secure identity management for students.
  

## Getting Started

Setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the project.

1. Generate a DID: You'll need to generate a DID. A DID is a unique identifier that's associated with a person, organization, or device. 

2. Create a Verifiable Credential: A verifiable credential is a piece of information that can be used to prove claims about a DID. In this case, it could be a proof of ownership of an XRP wallet.

3. Interact with XRP Ledger: To link the DID to an XRP wallet, you'll need to interact with the XRP Ledger. One can do this using the XRP Ledger API. You'll need to create an XRP wallet and associate it with the DID

### Prerequisites
